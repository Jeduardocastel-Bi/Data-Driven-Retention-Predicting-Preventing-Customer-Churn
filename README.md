# 🏋️‍♀️🏋️‍♂️10. Customer Retention Analysis for Model Fitness  

## 📖 Project Description  

**Model Fitness**, a chain of gyms, is developing a data-driven customer interaction strategy to address one of its most common challenges: customer churn.  

Churn occurs when a customer stops using the gym's services. This can happen explicitly (e.g., canceling a membership) or subtly (e.g., not renewing a contract). To combat this, Model Fitness has digitalized customer profiles and seeks insights to improve retention strategies.  

### Objectives:  
1. **Predict Churn Probability**: Forecast the likelihood of a customer leaving in the next month.  
2. **Customer Profiling**: Identify and describe key customer segments.  
3. **Analyze Influencing Factors**: Determine the variables most impacting customer churn.  
4. **Actionable Insights**:  
   - Identify target groups.  
   - Propose strategies to reduce churn.  
   - Highlight other behavioral patterns related to customer interaction.

## 📊 Project Results  
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Identified key trends in customer behavior.  
   - Detected correlations between gym attendance, membership type, and churn rates.  

2. **Data Cleaning and Preparation:**  
   - Handled missing values and inconsistencies.  
   - Processed categorical and numerical features for machine learning models.  

3. **Customer Segmentation:**  
   - Defined distinct customer groups based on age, contract type, attendance frequency, and engagement levels.  
   - High-risk groups (e.g., occasional users and short-term contract holders) were identified.  

4. **Churn Prediction Model:**  
   - Developed a **machine learning model** using **Scikit-learn** to predict customer churn.  
   - Evaluated model performance using **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**.  

5. **Key Churn Influencing Factors:**  
   - Low attendance frequency.  
   - Short-term membership contracts.  
   - Lack of participation in gym events or programs.  

6. **Retention Strategies Proposed:**  
   - Targeted promotions for at-risk members.  
   - Personalized offers and engagement programs.  
   - Incentives for long-term memberships.
