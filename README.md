# 🏋️‍♀️🏋️‍♂️10. Customer Retention Analysis for Model Fitness  

## 📖 Project Description  

**Model Fitness**, a chain of gyms, is developing a data-driven customer interaction strategy to address one of its most common challenges: customer churn.  

Churn occurs when a customer stops using the gym's services. This can happen explicitly (e.g., canceling a membership) or subtly (e.g., not renewing a contract). To combat this, Model Fitness has digitalized customer profiles and seeks insights to improve retention strategies.  

### Objectives:  
1. **Predict Churn Probability**: Forecast the likelihood of a customer leaving in the next month.  
2. **Customer Profiling**: Identify and describe key customer segments.  
3. **Analyze Influencing Factors**: Determine the variables most impacting customer churn.  
4. **Actionable Insights**:  
   - Identify target groups.  
   - Propose strategies to reduce churn.  
   - Highlight other behavioral patterns related to customer interaction.
