# 🏋️‍♀️🏋️‍♂️10. Customer Retention Analysis for Model Fitness  

## 📖 Project Description  

**Model Fitness**, a chain of gyms, is developing a data-driven customer interaction strategy to address one of its most common challenges: customer churn.  

Churn occurs when a customer stops using the gym's services. This can happen explicitly (e.g., canceling a membership) or subtly (e.g., not renewing a contract). To combat this, Model Fitness has digitalized customer profiles and seeks insights to improve retention strategies.  

### Objectives:  
1. **Predict Churn Probability**: Forecast the likelihood of a customer leaving in the next month.  
2. **Customer Profiling**: Identify and describe key customer segments.  
3. **Analyze Influencing Factors**: Determine the variables most impacting customer churn.  
4. **Actionable Insights**:  
   - Identify target groups.  
   - Propose strategies to reduce churn.  
   - Highlight other behavioral patterns related to customer interaction.

## 📊 Project Results  
### 🔍 Loyal Customer Segments  
- **Clusters 1 and 3:** These groups show **low churn rates**, indicating that they are highly engaged and active users.  
- **Retention Strategy:**  
  - Implement a **loyalty program** to further encourage gym attendance and spending on additional services.  
  - **For Cluster 3:** Offer **discounts** or promotions allowing them to bring a guest for a limited time. This would help with retention while simultaneously attracting new customers.  
  - **For Cluster 1:** These members have a membership but visit less frequently. **Incentives or discounts** can encourage them to use their membership more often and strengthen their commitment to the brand.  

### 🚨 High-Risk Customer Segments  
- **Clusters 0 and 2:** These groups have **low visit frequency and high churn rates** but still spend money on **additional services**.  
- **Retention Strategy:**  
  - Develop **bundled offers** that integrate gym access with extra services.  
  - Example: Create **packages** that grant **gym access + extra classes or swimming pool privileges** to encourage regular attendance.
